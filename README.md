Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well?
The driverpass project was a request for software that could allow drivers education students to take their courses online as opposed to in person, and also allowed them access to all study information regarding driving. It also allows students to schedule times with drivers that could help guide them and let them practice driving on the road. They wanted us to design a cloud based system. I think that I did a good job listening to the customer's requirements and making sure that they would be implemented into the software.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think that I would revise my business requirements document. I chose this because I feel like I could have written it more clearly in order to aid the development team in their execution of bringing those requirements to life.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I made sure that each of their requirements was listed and if there were any items they wanted that we were simply unable to do, I let them know and still did the best I could to create the software into something they want. I also kept them informed each step of the way of what was going on.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I always plan on asking the customer if there are any specific designs they had in mind first, because this project is their vision, not mine. I am here to bring their vision to life, so I gather as much information as possible in order to do so. I think in the future I would definitely use an agile based approach to the project, and make sure that there was on-going communication between the product owner, scrum master, and developer.
